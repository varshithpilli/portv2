      <h2>About me,</h2>
      <p className={classes.text}>
      I'm a computer science student passionate about Generative AI, backend systems, and API development. I enjoy exploring how large language models, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation can be applied to real-world problems. Alongside my coursework, I build side projects that combine GenAI with robust backend architectures, focusing on RESTful APIs, efficient pipelines, and cloud deployment. My interests lie at the intersection of AI-driven applications and scalable software engineering, and Iâ€™m always looking to push boundaries through research, experimentation, and hands-on development.
